    <h2>World longest beach - Cox's Bazar</h2>
    <p>The city of Cox's Bazar is situated more than 150 km to the south of Chittagong, a prominent port city on the Bay of Bengal. It serves as the administrative headquarters for the Cox's Bazar district. The town derived its name from Hiram Cox, a British officer associated with the East India Company, who passed away in the area in 1798.
<br>
        Situated on a coastal plain in the southeastern region of Bangladesh, Cox's Bazar is positioned 150 km south of Chittagong, an industrial port. Traveling to Cox's Bazar from the capital, Dhaka, takes approximately an hour by flight or about four hours by bus, covering a distance of nearly 400 km.
        <br>
        Cox's Bazar boasts an impressive stretch of over 120 km, making it the longest natural sea beach globally. In 2008, it was nominated as one of the "New 7 Wonders of Nature." The beach is typically 200m wide at high tide and expands to 400m wide at low tide. This Bay of Bengal attraction is a popular destination, attracting both local and international tourists, even during the off-season.</p>
